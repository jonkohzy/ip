# Jonk UI Test Plan

## Session configuration

- Run the test cases in the listed order in one fresh Jonk process. The task list is therefore shared between cases.
- Compile and run with the Java version required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Start the command-line test process with `java -cp build/classes/java/main jonk.Jonk`; `./gradlew run` starts
  the JavaFX application.
- Use `test/gui-test-plan.md` for the JavaFX-specific interaction checks.
- A line whose trimmed content is only Jonk's underscores frames each command response. Record it in the session transcript, but exclude it from the expected-output comparison.
- Before comparison, convert CRLF line endings to LF and expand each tab to four spaces in both actual and expected output. Do not otherwise trim or ignore whitespace or output lines.
- Before starting the session, replace `./data/jonk.txt` with the exact startup fixture below. After each case that specifies expected data-file contents, read the file and compare it exactly after converting CRLF line endings to LF.
- Stop the session immediately after the first failure.
- Check that the startup greeting includes `Type help to see the available commands.`.

**Startup data-file fixture:**

```text
T | 1 | write \| report
D | 0 | return notes \\ room | 2019-10-15

E | 1 | project demo | 2019-10-16 | 2019-10-17
```

## UI-HELP-01: Show help with loaded tasks

**Aim:** Verify that help lists every supported command, examples, date rules, and task-number guidance without rewriting stored tasks.

**Inputs:**

```text
help
```

**Expected output:**

```text
Mission guide online. Here's what Jonk can do:
help - Show this help page.
list - Show all tasks and their task numbers.
todo DESCRIPTION - Add a task without a date.
  Example: todo read book
deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE - Add a task with a due date.
  Example: deadline return book /by 2026-09-15
event DESCRIPTION /from DATE /to DATE - Add an event with start and end dates.
  Example: event project meeting /from 2026-09-16 /to 2026-09-17
mark NUMBER - Mark a task as done. Example: mark 1
unmark NUMBER - Mark a task as not done. Example: unmark 1
delete NUMBER - Delete a task. Example: delete 1
find KEYWORD - Find tasks containing the keyword. Example: find book
bye - Close mission control.

Replace uppercase placeholders with your own values; do not type the placeholders.
Dates use yyyy-MM-dd, for example 2026-09-15.
Use task numbers from list, starting at 1, for mark, unmark, and delete.
Find matches are case-sensitive; their displayed numbers are not task numbers from list.
Descriptions and keywords may contain spaces and must not be empty.
Command words are lowercase. Type help, list, and bye without arguments.
Help does not change your tasks.
```
